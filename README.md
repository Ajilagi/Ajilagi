# Hello from the other side ðŸ‘‹ 
 I'm Mas Aji Pamungkas.<br>
 Are you coming to looking for just a code that works ? So i think here is not the place that you are looking for. <br>

 > Code isn't just a bunch of courier new text with some bracket or maybe another semicolon. It's like an art, should be beauty, make an illusion and enjoyable. Maybe it can't be understood by everyone, but behind that, there was an elegant abstraction. - @Ajilagi

 ### ðŸ”¶ My Core
- ðŸŽ¨ &mdash; Paint on text editor. <br>
 Love the art of layouting, structuring, and refactoring the code. (Iâ€™ll refactor the whole codebase and write tests for everything, but if thereâ€™s a jira ticket assigned to me for it, I ainâ€™t doing it ðŸ˜œ)
- ðŸ“Š &mdash; Statistic. <br>
